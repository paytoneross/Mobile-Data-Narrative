            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For my data narrative, I decided to write about Pearl Jam's 2024 world tour setlist data.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chose to write about this because Pearl Jam is one of my favorite bands, the
                new album they put out this year is killer,
                and the way they make their setlists is actually pretty interesting. Pearl Jam likes to write a unique
                setlist for
                every single show they play, and this makes their concerts super fun because you never know exactly what
                you are going to get.
                Because their setlists are always so unique, I wanted to analyze the data from their recent world tour
                and see what trends we can find.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, I wanted to categorize songs based on their concert rarity and
                determine a rough likelyhood that each song could be played at any concert going forward.
                We can use this data to predict certain key songs in the setlist, such as the main set opening and
                closing songs, as well as the encore opening and closing songs.
                And we can also group songs by record, and determine a likely spread of songs from each record that
                could be played at any given show.

          <div class="col-md-10">
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The data I used in this analysis is the setlists from every show between 5/4/24 and 9/29/24.
                To ensure it's accurate, I pulled the setlists from Pearl Jam's own
                website and then verified them through the website "setlist.fm"
                and the "Unofficial PJ Stat Tracker" fan app. I double verified them because Pearl Jam likes to "tag"
                songs within other songs, or just play
                snippits of certain songs and the official website doesn't always list those, so this makes sure I have
                the most accurate data possible. I also only used
                the data from their 2024 world tour, because the objective is to project likelyhood that songs could be
                played at future shows. The Dark Matter tour
                will obviously play a lot of songs from Dark Matter, so we can only guess how often these songs will be
                played in the future, but songs from past records
                will likely be played at a similar rate whenever Pearl Jam goes on tour again.
